    <h1>What is CSS? </h1>
  
    <p>CSS means Cascading Style Sheet, it is used to format the layout of a webpage. <br>
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the <br spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>
    <h2>Using CSS</h2>
    <li>
        
        <ul>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</ul>
        <ul>Internal: this is by using the <i>Style</i> in the <i>head</i> section</ul>
        <ul>External - by using a <i>link element</i>  to link to an external CSS file</ul>
    </li>
    <p>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</p>
